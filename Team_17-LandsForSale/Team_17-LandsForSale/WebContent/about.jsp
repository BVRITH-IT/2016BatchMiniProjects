<p style="color=white"><font size = 5>This project aims to provide a platform for buyers and sellers of land. It offers information about available plots of land under different categories and also passes on information about interested buyers to owners. Users should first register. After registration, login form will appear. The owner will post the land available for sale with all the required
details. Owners will post the different criteria of that land such as fixed rate, lease etc. And the buyers who are interested to buy these lands can view the land, its details and also communicate with the owner if he is interested to buy the land.</font> </p>
